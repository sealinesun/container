# DI containers interoperability

The "di-interop" project tries to bring interoperability between DI containers through discussions and trial.

The work done here is not endorsed by the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/), but we
adhere to its spirit and hope this project will pave the way for one or several PSRs.

## Using

You can install this package through Composer:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "di-interop/di": "*"
    }
}
```
